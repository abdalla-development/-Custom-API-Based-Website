# -Custom-API-Based-Website
Portfolio
    • This project uses (account.cloudmersive.com) API to fetch the data of the uploaded image to the server, that indicates you must implement html page that would allow the user to insert or browse his files to upload the barcode image, then the program will save the entered image in a local directory and it will request the data from the API and extract the barcode text and display it as a flask flash message.
    • The hard part was to get or determine the barcode image path that will be send by the API.
    • As future improvement will be by adding more API services to the server that the user can choose from.
